## BLTouch Wiring

Bigtreetech have recommended that the BL touch be plugged into the Z-stop and Servo ports and therefore the firmware has been configured as such.

<u>**Creality BLtouch**</u> - Many thanks to [nickwebcouk](https://github.com/nickwebcouk) for the info. Make sure to double check your pins, the red and blue have been reported as needing to be switched.

<u>**Others?**</u>

 If you have a BLtouch with different colours, the SKR Mini E3 pinouts you need are

## BLtouch Troubleshooting 

Just a few points from my experiences.

1. If the BLtouch lights up when you power on the printer.  You at least have the 5V wire in the correct place.  Within the printer BLtouch menu, select **Deploy Probe**  If the probe tip doesn't deploy, then you need to swap the two outer cables (GND + PA1)
2. I tried a few different pinouts before I actually read the manual.  Despite this, my BLtouch didnt fry itself, as long as you are using the Servo and Z-stop ports you should be ok if you get it wrong.  



## BLTouch Mount & Spacer

**Bltouch spacer** https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3466223

If you use a different mount, just make sure you update the offsets and recompile.  You can find these in the in **configuration.h**

```
/**
 * Z Probe to nozzle (X,Y) offset, relative to (0, 0).
 * X and Y offsets must be integers.
 *
 * In the following example the X and Y offsets are both positive:
 * #define X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 10
 * #define Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 10
 *
 *     +-- BACK ---+
 *     |           |
 *   L |    (+) P  | R <-- probe (20,20)
 *   E |           | I
 *   F | (-) N (+) | G <-- nozzle (10,10)
 *   T |           | H
 *     |    (-)    | T
 *     |           |
 *     O-- FRONT --+
 *   (0,0)
 */
#define X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -43  // X offset: -left  +right  [of the nozzle]
#define Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -6  // Y offset: -front +behind [the nozzle]
#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 0   // Z offset: -below +above  [the nozzle]

```
