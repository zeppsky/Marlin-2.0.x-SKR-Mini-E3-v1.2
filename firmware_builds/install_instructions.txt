Install instructions:

Rename firmware_x to firmware.bin and copy to your SD card. 
Turn off your printer, insert card and turn on. 
Firmware should just flash after 10/20 seconds.

I've only tested firmware_bltouch_zaxis, so if you have any issues please check out my github and configure the build yourself.
